hey guys and girls how's it going so here is my second which a video this one is on the main story of The Witcher 2 now there are five key choices from the second game that can change the overall storyline quite significantly as these are pretty crucial I'll be highlighting and explaining the choices available and the decisions I made plus the consequences when we get to them as some of you may already know a CD Projekt RED have included a way for you to incorporate these decisions into The

Witcher 3 and they have said that this will be done through an interrogation scene at the start of the third game okay so let's get into the main storyline so the widget - is set one month after the end of the first game now the game starts with Gerald imprisoned in Lavallette dungeon after receiving a beating from the guards he is interrogated by a guy called Vernon Roach a Vernon Roach is the commander of the blue stripes and these are basically two Marius Special Forces now we learn very quickly early on that Geralt has

been arrested for the murder of king foltest and during the course of the prologue he pretty much recounts the events of the battle leading to photos' death in an attempt to prove his innocence now the flashback starts with Geralt waking up in a tent next to a very naked at Triss Merigold now they are interrupted by a very flustered soldier and Geralt is summoned to fault aside as his own personal witcher bodyguard and lucky charm during the battle now attacking the castle in a siege tower Geralt storms

the castle wall fighting his way through Laval at night while obviously continually protecting the Kings back the king of all tests then faced a guy called Aryan la Villette and this is where your first choice will happen Geralt sneaks past the soldiers and faces Aryan alone and it is here that he has a choice kill Aryan by challenging him to a duel kill Aryans guards and then kill in himself Oh spare his life now to explain who Aryan lavallette is Aaron is a noble youth who is very honorable and

is effectively fighting king foltest to protect the honor of his mother and his siblings now fall test had actually slept with his mother who had given her given birth to two bastard children and then was pretty much abandoned and her honor besmirched and just ruined by these events now Aryan is very angry at fall test and he's angry that fall test is trying to claim these two children now as his heirs because you know Fortis has no no longer has any heirs as a result of Princess adder dying now

feeling sympathetic to Aryan my Geralt pretty much took pity on him and convinced him to surrender thus saving his own life and that of his soldiers now as Gerald and Vernon Roach and the King make their way to the monastery which is where the children are being kept safe they are unexpectedly attacked by a dragon as this separates wrote from Geralt and felt tests and from this point on and Geralt basically tells you know how how the King died so Geralt helps carry the King to safety and he hurts the dragon with his silver sword

which causes the dragon to fly off but sadly Garrett loses his sword in the process they then find the children and who is being protected by a blind monk monk now fall test embraces his children and Garrett looks away I think a little embarrassed and he just looks away into a window no trying to give the King a bit of privacy as he tries to reconnect with his children unfortunately Geralt notices too late that the monk is not what he appears and as he runs towards the King he fails to stop the assassin who slits foltest

throat the assassin then removed his disguise revealing himself to be a Witcher and he then jumps out of the window and escapes with the help of group of Scoy Attell in a boat Geralt is left over the dead body of king foltest carrying you know holding a bloody sword and of course he's then arrested and thrown into prison and the flashback pretty much ends there after hearing gilts story Vernon ultimately believes his innocence and agrees to help Geralt escape and find the truth you know the true Kingslayer

Roach offers Geralt some food and drink and to sort of M replenish his energy and this actually triggers a flashback as Garrett regains some of his lost memory now just so you guys know within this video I'm not going to really talk about these flashbacks in too much detail I am actually planning to sort of incorporate all of these flashbacks in a separate video where I'm going to compile them together and sort of make a compilation video so you guys will be able to watch them and get an idea of of

you know Daryl's memory and his past and what he sort of learns or remembers during the course of the witcher 2 now um Roche leaves Geralt with a key and using this Geralt knocks his two guards unconscious and he escapes the prison by sort of sneaking through the prison the prison itself and knocking out any guards that he comes across now before leaving the prison he actually does find and help Aryan lavallette to escape now Aryan and you know before escaping decides to torch the prison it burns it

down this actually provides a descreption for girl who's able to use this to escape out to the docks where he's able to get onto a boat with Tris and Roche and escape to mariya and that is pretty much the end of the prologue in Chapter one Vernon Roach Tris and Geralt head to flotsam following a lead that the assassin has been spotted there and is being helped by a local squirtle leader a guide called llaves now landing on the beaches near flotsam they immediately run into your vet and it

becomes very clear very quickly that there is no love lost between your Vieth and roach now of course that makes sense as a commander of Sumerian special forces Roach has extensive experience in fighting against and killing the score tell and all non-human terrorists as he sees them your vet on the other hand is a very strong-willed rebel and could be really considered the Malcolm X of the score you tell he is willing to kill and take whatever drastic actions needed to achieve his goals of attaining the

freedom and equal rights for all nonhumans Gerald talks to your vith to distract him and while Tris readies a spell now the spell subtly backfires and you're with replies with a hail of arrows which Tris is able to deflect using a protective bubble which she places around them but not before collapsing from the effort now Roach carries her to safety while Geralt follows picking off any score tell who entered the bubble along the way the three of them do manage to escape you're with Anna's archers and they arrived in

flotsam unscathed thankfully though surprised to see a public execution taking place and even more shocked to see dandelion and Zoltan chivay about to be hung my girl obviously steps him because they're his best friends and he fights the guards and the executioner and manages to convince the Commandant of the town a guy called Laredo to release his friends in exchange for his Witcher services larita agrees telling Geralt to meet him at night and Geralt Triss Zoltan and dandelion basically catch up over a few pints of ale at the

local Inn now while telling tales and catching up and having a laugh basically they are interrupted by a villager who storms into the inn screaming at people to run away from a monstrous beast that's attacking attacking the village Geralt rushes outside to witness a sorceress fighting a kaerun now this is a beast that kind of looks like a Kraken the monster flees and tris introduces Geralt to the sorceress who is called Sheila dead hands oval now she's a powerful sorceress and also an advisor to Queen Zulekha of Kovic

garol is asked by a town official to take on a contract to kill the k ram and which he accepts and he agrees to work with sheila to you know destroy you know to kill the monster which is basically preventing any trade happening down the Ponte you know down the VAT down the river now following a lead and they seek the help of a guy called Cedric now he's an elf and an ex squirtle and he points Gerald in the direction of the Kieran's lair and tris learns from testing the beasts mucus that it has been created by

magic in his highly poisonous with his knowledge Geralt begins by creating an antidote to the poison using some Ostmark that he found in an elven rune and that's a big big part of being a Witcher so preparing for a fight and finding Lee you know the monsters weakness and its strength and obviously drinking potions to prepare yourself for it so it does what any good which it does basically and that now that he's ready with sila Dayton's evil he actually faces off against the Quran and through a combination of potions

signs and and sword skill slays the beast and collects his reward now interested in what the Commandant needs he actually goes to Laredos house at night and unexpectedly runs into roach who also wants to talk to the common done using Rocha as a distraction Geralt sneaks into the Commandant house to speak to him Lorado reveals his concerns about the neighbouring score tel and believes that your veeth will attack soon to free the nonhuman prisoners which are being held in his prison barge he asked Geralt to use his connections

with Zoltan chivay unknown supporter of the scoid tell to find out what your with plans now before speaking to Zoltan Tris and Gerald decide to sneak into the prison barge to interrogate the prisoner they speak to your vez right-hand man a guy called Karin I think I said that right who with some persuasion reveals that the Kingslayer he was actually a guy called Lefou betrayed him and intends to kill llaves betraying the sky oh tell leader he asks Carol to warn llaves before passing out now this whole

composition again triggers a flashback and Geralt remembers more of his past including a sorceress who tried to save his life called yennefer now actually just so you guys know yennefer is a pretty big character and she's actually the love of girl's life though they do have a rocky relationship she's Tricia's friend maybe best friend and she's also a mother figure to Cirie now ciri is another major character that's going to be in the third game that girl is trying to find throughout

the course of the game series more like a daughter to Geralt and also obviously a daughter to yennefer and so that's just to give you guys a little bit of information so you kind of know that these are pretty important characters for the third game now despite sort of remembering you know yennefer and Geralt Geralt memory is still vague and he doesn't remember much of her in detail but he wants to desperately and tris suggests using a rose of remembrance from an Asian elven ruin which is

renowned for having amazing regenerative powers and they find the roses and after a brief skirmish with [ __ ] with folks fall into an ancient chamber which seems to have a conveniently placed hot spring bath that Tris and Gerald clearly can't resist taking advantage of now after some mmm quality time Tris takes a rose and informs Geralt it will take a few days to make a potion Gerrit leaves Tris and meets up with Zoltan who arranges a meeting with llaves tell him of letõs plan betrayal he is at first skeptical but then agrees

to test a theory by confronting Lefou pretending to be Geralt prisoner now as Garrett leaves your death to let those location he asks him about his aims and motivations and Yahveh through Veals that he killed kings like fall test and demo vid as he felt that these monix were corrupt and needed to be purged he then goes on to hint that he actually knows somebody in the east that he thinks would be a much better Manik but at this point he doesn't say who now meeting Lefou by the elven ruins he admits to his betrayal and reveals to

Geralt that the witcher had once saved his life and he actually knew him very well now the scene is abruptly interrupted as Vernon Roach attacks with his soldiers and it is here that we make our crucial second choice now we must choose whether to side with you of F or with Vernon Roach now the decision that you make at this point completely changes the direction of the storyline as you can split off into two into two completely separate paths now I actually decided to side with llaves as I ultimately agreed with his

ideals of equality between humans and nonhumans and I was curious about this person that he mentioned in the east and I also had a grudging respect for the rebel and he's a determination to change things for the better now if you are interested in roaches paths I will post a link in in the description below to a playthrough that shows that storyline plot so so the remainder of the story of course will be just entirely on your Visp ass now to continue while you're with foot Roach girl actually fights Lefou who is a very

powerful foe pretty much equal in strength and skill and Leto overpowers Geralt briefly and reveals his intent to kidnap Triss Merigold and use her to teleport him to to Eden now Geralt rushes to flotsam to save trysts only define himself too late and Garret meets with u of F and tells him leather has escaped yo've a--the is not happy and he does agree though to help the witcher and travel to Edun and the town of vergon to track down left though and rescue Tris sneaking into flotsam they steal the

prison part and sail to air dam and that is the end of chapter one the beginning of chapter two starts with a negotiation between King hound sulk of kaedwen and prince Stannis and the warrior Saskia of now Saskia is known as the virgin of Eden and a slayer of dragons and she is a famous hero within the region both sides are on the brink of war and they're arguing over land and with hence out wanting to expand his territory and Stannis insisting that he'll protect it warning himself to avoid conflict at all

costs the talks pretty much goes south and fighting breaks out now hands held in the midst of the fighting kills a monk and by an ancient shrine and this seems to trigger a curse just as dandelion Zoltan Gerald and llaves arrive they witness the curse as the Sun goes dark they fight their way to Saskia and Prince Stannis henselt and Cielo have actually already escaped through a portal and they're left you know to fight the race that appear all seems lost until a mysterious glowing golden owl appears and sheltering them

from the race and providing safe passage through the mist once safe the owl turns into philippa eilhart a powerful sorceress and aid to Saskia now traveling to virgon a dwarven City Saskia reveals it to be a safe haven for all outcasts including humans and nonhumans I Geralt is summoned to the council meeting where they decide to employ the help of The Witcher and Philippa to lift the curse and Philippa reveals that in order to do this they actually need to learn the story of a battle that took place there three years

earlier where Kidwai knee and edenian troops actually fought and they need to find three objects which are symbolic of the battle to be able to lift the curse now your faith enters offering his support and that of his archers to Saskia who it's clear he places a lot of hope in she is the perfect Manik that he mentioned earlier and it's easy to see why he puts so much trust in her she is Noble pure and charismatic even succeeding in convincing everyone to accept llaves despite their initial reservations while

drinking a toast unfortunately poisoned and collapses creating chaos in virgon now Philippa reveals that she is dying and that the only cure is a special herb called an immortal a rose of remembrance a huge quantity of magical power in the form of an artifact and royal blood Geralt begins his quest by retrieving an immortal and with the help of Zoltan and a band of dwarfs he fights his way through monster infested mines to find the healing herb speaking to Philippa Geralt reveals that Tris actually has the Rose of Remembrance

herself and insists that they must find her Philippa offers to use a spell to locate Tris but first we'll need an item that's close to her now Geralt follows clues given by Philippa and interrogate a drunken dwarf overheard telling stories of a redheaded woman that fell from the sky the dwarf tells Geralt that Tris was kidnapped by a troll upon interrogating the troll Garrett learns that she escaped and that her handkerchief was taken by his his misses his wife after a jealous lovers spat effectively Geralt saves her from a

band of kid when he could win 'i'm mercenaries and she gives him the handkerchief in her gratitude using this Philippa locates Tricia's presence on the other side of the mist in the midst of the cadw in Ian's camp aided by Philippa Geralt travels travels through the mist he unexpectedly meets Vernon Roach who is still angry at him for siding with your vet but garel asks rope for roaches help and though he's reluctant at first he does give in after Gale reminds him of his quest to stop

left though and also bring justice to fault s murderer he tells the witcher of a secret passageway through a horse camp now after bribing the mistress Geralt finds the entrance and and he sneaks through it um but um he as he's getting on the other side he stumbles across a dead body and he actually finds a strange figurine on it which is very strange but he picks it up and collects it and then sadly and as he's trying to make his way through to the camp Geralt is actually captured on the outskirts of

the nilfgaardian camp and is interrogated by the Ambassador to Rudi Nia he discovers that Tris is being kidnapped within the form of a figurine and is unable to rescue her now Geralt is nearly executed though he is rescued just in time by Vernon Roche breaking into the CAD winnie camp and with Roach's help he actually sneaks into the king consults tent and takes a drop of blood at sword point which is the second item that's needed to cure Saskia that of royal blood he offers to lift the

mist in return for safe passage out of the camp and hence other effectively Hensel agrees after returning to Philippa and giving her the royal blood and the rose of remembrance which was found in and the the outer shell of the of the figure because Trish's figure was hidden within so he finds it in the outer shell and Gale continues his quest by looking for the final element to the cure an artifact of power which he does ultimately find within a harpy nest trapped in a dream stone the dream stone

of a dragon so harpies basically collect dreams and they've actually collected one from a dragon which is very curious now returning all four for parts of the Keota Philippa she finally cured Saskia using a combination of a combination of alchemy and magic now that Saskia is healed and the people of vergon have their leader back Garrett lifts the curse by collecting and presenting three objects connected to the battle in order to lift the curse Geralt must reenact key moments from the battle and the taking of the enemy

standard dodging a hail of arrows to get reinforcements and a final battle between two of its strongest generals a guy called Selkirk of gullet and Vandegrift the mist lifts the myth the mist is lifted the and the stage is set for a confrontation between King hensel's forces and Saskia's troops thus begins the siege of the virgam now Geralt plays a major role in the defense of vagon and helping to drop hot oil onto the enemy troops below and defending its walls surviving two ways of attacks Geralt rushes with with

Saskia to the Dwarven mines to guard the tunnels under the key from invasion finding kid when Ian's troops and the girl soon dispatches them but is knocked unconscious by hensel's personal mage called death mold now just when all seems lost Saskia suddenly begins to glow and turns into a huge golden dragon it's the same dragon that actually attacked Geralt at Laviolette Castle now Saskia reveals her secret to Geralt and asks him to keep it hidden fearing the villagers reaction if they

discovered she was a dragon believing it would divide their camp and cause dispute and turmoil returning to the city walls Saskia gives a rousing speech to the scared villagers and she reminds them of what future what the future may hold should Hensel win death and slavery she reminds them of the ideals that they fight for freedom and equality and the future where upper-air Dhin can be independent and humans and nonhumans live in peace the battle resumes and girl Zoltan and Saskia defend the walls

Phillipa fights hensel's mage and llaves provides support you know from his archers from above Henson is defeated and ultimately surrenders agreeing to the execution of his mage death mold as a war criminal and recognizing Saskia's claim to become queen of vergon and upper Eden's right to become a fully independent state separate from the rest of Eden upon farming Philippa and Saskia and they actually see the two woman women suddenly disappear through a portal from investigating filibus home

they learned that the sorceress has actually subjugated Saskia's mind and by using the rose of remembrance and now has control over a very powerful dragon which she intend in intends to unleash to her advantage at the summer the Council on Conclave which is going to take place in a in a place called la Queen where the most powerful mages sorcerers and monarchs of the northern kingdoms will be gathered so suffice to say not good saying farewell to Zoltan and dandelion and who remain in virgon

Europe and Geralt actually travel to LACMA Wien hoping to stop philippa eilhart plans and that's the end of chapter 2 at the beginning of chapter 3 we see trace being freed from the spell that binds her by an elf guardian sorceress now she's taken hostage by the nilfgaardian ambassador and we assume that she is tortured and interrogated the scene then cuts to garel Dani of F as they sneak into lot more een in search of philippa eilhart overhearing a conversation between two guards talking about King

rat Ovid and his decision to throw Philippa in the dungeon Geralt is left with his third choice and perhaps his most difficult one does he rescue Triss Merigold from torture and perhaps death or does he rescue philippa eilhart now although my Geralt did care deeply fortress and he did want to rescue her desperately he decided that his duty as a Witcher actually must come first and that if Philippa was to die Saskia would never be freed from her mind control and decided that sorceresses could not be allowed to

control a powerful Dragon which could tip the scale of power in the region dangerously now sneaking into the prison Gerald over his a conversation between King Radovic radovid of redania and Philippa L had now radovid reveals that he had Tris tortured who revealed to him the existence of a secret society called the lodge of sorceresses now she admitted to him that the sorceresses had ordered Lefou to assassinate several kings including for 'test and Denver and radovid accuses her of killing his father and of plotting to

kill him too she protests his accusation very mentally but she's unable to the torture that rather radovid has planned for her and as her eyes are being gouged out with a spoon she screams in agony now guilt rushes into the prison dispatches the guards and rescues Philippa while escorting her to safety with llaves health she reveals that she actually has an enchanted she enchanted a special dagger capable of freeing Saskia from the spell and leads girl Annie over to a magical chest that turns

out to be a trap using the distraction to advantage she escapes leaving Geralt to face the monster protecting the chest alone defeating it guilt recovers the dagger but sadly Philip er has disappeared she's gone and that's the last that we see of her in The Witcher 2 so it'll be interesting to see if she reappears in the third game and what's what's become of her now rushing to the talks llaves and Geralt witnessed the negotiations and the roux talks revealed that Prince Stannis has actually crowned

himself king of Eden now Saskia is there too and she argues that the free people of abuddin do not recognize his claim and that they will remain independent and free ruled by queen Saskia she speaks in favor of reinstituting the council and the Conclave of mages and sorceresses but suddenly the talks are interrupted as the nilfgaardian ambassador storms into the talks with Lefou in Chains now levels the plot of the lodge of sorceresses and he also named philippa eilhart and sheila de tan servile as accomplices Saskia attacks

them in the form of a dragon protecting Sheila Deaton servile and Geralt faces the dragon and you know dodging her fire attacks is he wishes to catch shilajit and zobelle before she can escape gloating at Geralt she attempts to use a mega scope to teleport away but as the machine begins to spark and glow orange it's clear that it has been sabotaged and here is where Geralt faces his fourth choice now he has a choice leave the corrupt crystal inside the Machine and allow Sheila to die or remove the

crystal and save her life now figuring that she had information potentially useful to his mission my Geralt decided to spare her and in gratitude she tells him of letõs betrayal and his collaboration with nilfgaard who wished to weaken the northern kingdoms in preparation for an invasion she finishes by tearing telling Geralt to go south to nilfgaard where he will find yennefer before she vanishes now with Sheila gone Saskia goes wild and Geralt is left to fight her he fights the dragon jumping onto her back

and forcing her to the ground impaled on a tree branch Geralt then uses the sword to break the spell binding her to Philippa now having regained her memory Saskia returns to virgon intent on ruling and creating a place of hope and peace for nonhumans and outcasts and this is the end of chapter 3 finally the story of the second game closes with an epilogue Garrett begins the epilogue by confronting Lefou and we are asked now to make our fifth and final choice we can either let let her go or kill him

now I decided first to speak to let tho and he revealed how he had helped yennefer after my death and he recounts how after Geralt had sacrificed himself to save yennefer from the wild one she was left vulnerable and weak suffering from amnesia like Geralt so it's curious to see whether the yennefer that we meet in the witcher 3 remembers Geralt or whether again she has amnesia now as a powerful sorceress this makes her potentially very very dangerous so it's going to be really interesting to see what happens there

now let the revealed to Geralt how he he and the other witches had actually protected yennefer until they were ultimately separated in nilfgaard and it does look like you know Geralt is going to be traveling into nilfgaard through this sort of marching army in the third game now left also explains to guarantee his motivations behind the assassinations and that he agreed to help me off guard weaken the northern kingdoms in exchange for support and rebuilding the witches school of the viper which is an important goal given the

dwindling numbers of the witches now my Geralt ultimately took pity on my foe and decided to allow him to leave with his life finally through the epilogue we see the consequences of our choices we witness King rat Ovid as he begins his witch hunts now distrust and hate have spread throughout the northern kingdoms as you know common folk turn against mages Sorceress's and even witches and we witnessed the terrible torture and burning of anyone with magical skill we learned that flotsam has become a

military base and the Ponte Valley and virgon have become a promised land for outcasts and we finally learned that tameria has been divided between king rat Ovid and King Hensel finally in the closing scene we see the black troops of nilfgaard as they invade the north and this all sets the scene for the start of the witcher 3 so there you have it that is the main story of the second game and I do apologize guys this get this video is much longer than what I was originally anticipating I was hoping to

do this in the 20 minute video but there is so much content within the second game that you really do need to know and to understand the witcher 3 so i hope you guys didn't mind that I did really go into detail with this and I hope you guys were able to follow it as you were going along so I hope you guys found this video useful and that it has prepared you for the witcher 3 and as i said i've tried to cover all the major plot points and choices that you need to know for the third game now if you have
